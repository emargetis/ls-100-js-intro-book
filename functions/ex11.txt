No they are different variables. 

The ones on line 1&2 are local variables because they are parameters for the function. 
They will shadow the other left and right within the local scope of the function.

The ones on line 10-12 are global variables and will be accessible anywhere in the program after they are declared, 
including being used as arguments when calling the multiply function on line 12.
